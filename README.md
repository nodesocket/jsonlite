# JSONlite

##### A simple, self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, [json](http://www.json.org/) document store.

JSONlite sandboxes the current working directory just like [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). The data directory is named `jsonlite.data`, and each json document is saved pretty printed as a uuid.

## Proof of Concept

JSONlite is a proof of concept, and it may not make any sense to actually use it in development or production.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/nodesocket/jsonlite.git
cd jsonlite
ln -s $PWD/jsonlite.sh /usr/local/bin/jsonlite
```

## Requirements

1. bash
2. uuidgen
3. YAJL's `json_reformat`

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into the release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, JSONlite will be maintained under the semantic versioning guidelines.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

+ Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
+ New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
+ Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
